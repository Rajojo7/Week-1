Garbage classification
This project focuses on the automatic classification of waste into six categories: cardboard, plastic, paper, metal, trash, and glass. By leveraging image recognition and machine learning techniques, the system accurately identifies the type of garbage, enabling more efficient recycling and waste management. The goal is to promote environmental sustainability by simplifying the sorting process and reducing human error in waste segregation.
